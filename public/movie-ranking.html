      This is one of the most beautiful animation movie I have ever seen. This
      movie basically focus on the struggles of brother and sister who are in
      the middle of world war in japan and have no one to rely on so they take
      care of each other. It's story is very emotional. A must watch for sure.

    <h3>Ramayana: The Legend of Prince Rama</h3>
    <p>
      Again another animation movie.This is by far the best animated adaptation
      of Ramayana. The songs are very beautiful too. This movie is made by a
      both Indian and Japanese animator. The story follows Ramayana. Again Must
      watch for sure.
